# Project Notes for Gemini

## Tailwind CSS CDN Usage

**Warning:** The current setup uses the Tailwind CSS CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`). This is not recommended for production environments due to performance and build size considerations.

**Recommendation:** For production deployment, it is highly recommended to install Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin or use the Tailwind CLI. Refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation for detailed installation instructions:

*   [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

This will allow for better optimization, purging unused CSS, and a more robust build process.
